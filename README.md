## Introduction
----
This was my actual submitted & completed project on Udacity Advanced Data Analysis - introduction Data analysis section -this dataset was chosen from many other:  
   - TMDb movie data
   - No show appointments
   - Gapminder World
   - Soccer Database
   - FBI Gun Data  
you can find most of them on Kaggle and the last one is on github

I found this particular dataset interesting because this was my first time to deal with an sqlite file in Pandas and there are plenty of tables that you can practice your data wrangling and data cleaning capabilities on .. despite i am not a very big fan of soccer i loved this project because i learned so much from

note : there are no files needed in this project but first you have to download the dataset from Kaggle [Here](https://www.kaggle.com/hugomathien/soccer) to get to work

Any data student or data analyst who finds that he has the time to make some commits to add more questions with answers or suggest modification to the existing code in my ipy notebook i will be so appreciative

You can easily find data about soccer matches but they are usually scattered across different websites. A thorough data collection and processing has been done to make your life easier. I must insist that you do not make any commercial use of the data. The data was sourced from:

 - Scores, lineup, team formation and events [from here](http://football-data.mx-api.enetscores.com)

 - Betting odds: If you want to understand the column naming system for betting odds [from here](http://www.football-data.co.uk/)

### Questions about player

####  -  (Research Question 4) Which players had the most penalties? 
####  -  (Research Question 5) What player attributes lead to the highest overall rating ?
